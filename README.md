# Design Choice: 

**Landing Page:**
    Full background image of the Marvel characters to emphasize the theme of the game.   
    If i decide to use the background image I need to find the correct color font that will
    display over the image. Including the transparent the container for the text helps the text stand out.

**Ready Page**
    
**Font:** Comic Neue   

**Colors:**
