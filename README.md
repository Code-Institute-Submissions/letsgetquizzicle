# Bugs
1. I wanted to create a score system that added points when the player selected the correct answer and minus a point if the players 
selected the wrong answer. I was able to increment the score but encountered a issue when I tried to minus a point. DevTols console
was showing that my function was correct.  
The Fix: With the help of a fellow student, the bug was eventually resolved by adding a cosole.log into the else statement.
