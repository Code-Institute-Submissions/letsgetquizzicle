 TRIVIA GAME   

For my project I will create a trivia game using Javascript.  
I will create a quizz game based on Marvel.   
I will have a highscore, progress bar, number of questions remaining, username 
The questions will have 4 possible answers.   

Possible categories - Marvel, Disney, Harry Potter. Not sure which theme
I want to go with.
